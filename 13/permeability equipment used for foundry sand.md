• Foundry sands are composed almost entirely of silica (SiO2) in the form of quartz.Some impurities may be present,such as ilmenite (FeO‐TiO2),magnetite (Fe3O4),or olivine,which is composed of magnesium and ferrous orthosilicate [(Mg,Fe) SiO4].Silica sand is usedFoundry sand testing WikipediaFoundry sand testing is a process used to determine if the foundry sand has the correct properties for a certain casting process.The sand is used to make moulds and cores via a pattern.In a sand casting foundry there are broadly two reasons for rejection of the casting — metal and sand — each of which has a large number of internal variables.
