## Multi cylinder cone crusher to produce better grain.
For example,excessive iron may cause the crusher to burn copper sleeve,rack cracking and main shaft fracture.Closed circuit crushing,used in the second stage of the broken can provide accurate grain size for fine crushing,avoid too many fine materials into the crushing cavity,so that the crushing cavity can achieve the ideal filling effect.The Common Malfunction Of Cone Crusher JXSCIt has a cool impact on the shaft thus causes the cone to break the main shaft to break to jam.On the other hand,when the crushing machine in an overload state for a long time,the main shaft is easy to break and cause the equipment to jam.It can not completely avoid the damage of the crusher plant even though has an overload protection device.
