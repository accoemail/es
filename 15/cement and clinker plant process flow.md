## Cement Production an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The cement production process,for example,starts with mining of limestone,which is then crushed and ground to powder.It is then preheated to save energy before being transferred to the kiln,the heart of the process.The kiln is then heated to a high temperature of up to 1480 degrees to convert the material to a molten form called clinker.How Cement Is MadeThe heated air from the coolers is returned to the kilns,a process that saves fuel and increases burning efficiency.After the clinker is cooled,cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone.Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.
