Valorization of pellets from municipal WWTP sludge in lightweight clay ceramics.we looked beyond these possible applications and analyzed the transformation of sewage sludge through a ceramization process into a material similar to expanded clays; we subsequently explored its uses in the building industry or in the agriculture industry.Amazon.com : Hydrofarm Growt GMC40l Clay Pebbles,4mm …That's absurd.There is so little clay baked onto the pebble that more of the burnt clay (the dark part of the rocks) remains exposed.This is not an aesthetic complaint.Clay pebbles were created and are favored by agriculturalists and gardners for a simple reason,they are easily washed and resused.

## Production Leca UK
During the LECA® LWA manufacturing process,the natural clay once treated and dried is passed through a rotary kiln and fired to a temperature of approximately 1150°C.This process expands the clay,fuses and melts to form pellets up to five times the clays original size.What are Clay Pebbles? Definition from MaximumYieldTo retain their round shape and allow water and nutrients to reach the plant's roots,clay pebbles are produced by firing round pieces of clay in a kiln.This process causes the clay to expand,which is why clay pebbles are sometimes called expanded clay pebbles.

Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate () often referred to Hydroton or clay pebbles consist of balls of clay that has been super heated (in a rotary kiln) from anywhere between 1100 to over 2000° F.This process causes popping,which creates the pebbles' characteristic pores.These pores,in addition to the spaces between pebbles,make Hydroton a light and airy growing medium that.Application of water treatment sludge in the manufacturing.These results are in general agreement with the mineralogy of expanded clay and expanded shale.Consequently,there appears to be potential to manufacture LWA from the WTS.After the sintering process,the pellets were moved to in a cooling room to cool down to room temperature.The previously indicated manufacturing process and.
