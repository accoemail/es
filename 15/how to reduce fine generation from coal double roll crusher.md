## Primary Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Figure 6.4 is a typical set up where ores crushed in primary and secondary crushers are further reduced in size by a rough roll crusher in an open circuit followed by finer size reduction in a closed circuit by a roll crusher.Such circuits are chosen as the feed size to standard roll crushers …Roll Crushers TENOVARoll crushers are often fed by apron feeders that direct feed material between a fixed and a moveable roll.The two crusher rolls,equipped with crushing segments,rotate inward and crush oversized material,while fine material passes the crusher without additional crushing.
