## Antimony: will China continue to control supply?
Nov 14,2018· Antimony is a little known metalloid commonly used in lead acid batteries and fire retardants,and while deposits are found worldwide,China's large resource,low cost of production and significant processing capacity has seen the country dominate market supply.However,a new plant …How Antimony is Processed by FlotationThe problem discussed in this antimony process study is limited to a concentrator capable of beneficiating 150 tons per day of antimony ore.The antimony in this study occurs as the mineral stibnite (Sb2S3) in association with small amounts of pyrite,arsenopyrite,galena and lead sulfantimonides.The gangue is composed largely of quartz but contains,in addition,a small amount of talc.

## USAC Mexico Mines us antimony
MEXICAN MINING OPERATIONS.Although USAC has extensive antimony mineralization at Thompson Falls,Montana,the time and cost of re permitting the mine as well as the uncertainty of even getting a permit caused USAC to return to Mexico to mine.Most of the Mexican antimony deposits are oxide ores or mixed oxide sulfide deposits.Antimony (Sb) and Arsenic (As) in Sb Mining Impacted Paddy.Foods produced on soils impacted by antimony (Sb) mining activities are a potential health risk due to plant uptake of the contaminant metalloids (Sb) and arsenic (As).Here we report for the first time the chemical speciation of Sb in soil and porewater of flooded paddy soil,impacted by active Sb mining,and its effect on uptake and speciation in rice plants (Oryza sativa L.cv Jiahua).

## The uptake and detoxification of antimony by plants: A.
Many crops cultivated in mining areas have been found to accumulate high levels of antimony (Sb) in their edible parts,thereby causing potential risks to human health.Understanding the behaviours of Sb in plants is important,particularly the mechanisms involved in its uptake,toxicity,detoxification and accumulation in crops.Antimony WikipediaAntimony is a chemical element with the symbol Sb (from Latin: stibium) and atomic number 51.A lustrous gray metalloid,it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (Sb 2 S 3).Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics,often known by the Arabic name,kohl.
