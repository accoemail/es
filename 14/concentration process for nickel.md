## Nickel Electroplating* CASF
nickel.Activated nickel anode materials are available commercially that resist the onset of passivity and replenish the solution with nickel ions over a wide range of plating conditions.Nickel Ion and pH Changes Under normal operating conditions,the nickel ion concentration and the pH of the solution will slowly increase as plating proceeds.The Risk Assessment Information SystemDeath due to nickel induced Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was reported for a worker spraying nickel using a thermal arc process (Rendall et al.1994).Death occurred 13 days following 90 minute exposure to an estimated nickel concentration of 382.1 mg m 3; total nickel intake was estimated at nearly 1 g.Nausea,vomiting,abdominal.
