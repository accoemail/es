## Hydrometallurgy Wikipedia
Hydrometallurgy is a method for obtaining metals from their ores.It is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy involving the use of aqueous chemistry for the recovery of metals from ores,concentrates,and recycled or residual materials.Metal chemical processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy,vapour metallurgy and molten salt electrometallurgy.How to Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination SciencingApr 25,2017· Grind the ore so that all parts of the ore are open to the HCL mixture.Add your ore to a plastic tub cement mixer along with 10 pounds of river rock and turn the mixer until the ore is 200 mesh or more.200 mesh means there are at least 200 particles in one square inch of ore.Remove the river rock,which will still be large.

## Hydrothermal mineral deposit geology Britannica.com
Hydrothermal mineral deposit,any concentration of metallic minerals formed by the precipitation of solids from hot mineral laden water (hydrothermal solution).The solutions are thought to arise in most cases from the action of deeply circulating water heated by magma.Other sources of heatingTypes of Extraction S cool,the revision websiteMethods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as ores.An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impurities.When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore.This is called extracting the metal.The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is.The more reactive the metal,the more difficult it is to.
